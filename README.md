pokemon_battle_generator
========================

goal: generate as many pokemon battles as reasonably possible on my laptop

So far, this code will only generate lots of variations on Greninja,
and these variations are only based on EVs and IVs.

Note to self: don't do plus/minus in Pokemon constructor, do Nature.

Current hierarchy of the code:
